        title: 'Recyclable vs recycled packaging',
        content: `'Before all, a recyclable pachkaging is a pachkaging  that can go thru the process of recycling and become raw material for industry again.

        In this way, we need to explain that not all recyclable packaging (that comes with the recyclable symbol) is in the matter of fact recycled!
        
        It happens to exist recycling precesses to many different kinds of packaging utilized materials. The big question, is that many of those are extremely expencive and end up not worthing the recycling.
        
        Beyond that, many times, the recycling process results in a low quality material, what ends up not compensating`

        title: `Plastic packages`,
        content: `When we speek of plastic packages, we need to have in mind that there are 7 kinds of plastics used in manufacturing (PET, PEAD, PEBD, PVC, PP, PS, Others).

        With the Others cathegory as an exception, all the others have some kind of process in which the recycling is possible. However, based on the process costs and lack of quality in the material, not all of them are recycled.`

        title: `Recycled packaging`,
        content: `PET (Polyethylene terephthalate): The same as the soda bottles.
        Recycling depends on the kind of packaging
        PVC (Polyvinyl chloride): Makes up the water and sewage pipes.
        PEBD (Low Density Polyethylene): It can be found in toys and computer parts.
        PEAD (High density polyethylene): Used to compose plastic supermarket bags.`

        title: `Non-recycled packaging`,
        content: `PP (Propylene): It is present in frozen food packaging.
        PS (Polystyrene): Makes up the famous disposables.
        Others: Within this category is the BOPP, type of material that composes laminated food packaging such as straw potatoes, cereal bars, snacks.`

        title: `Glass packaging`,
        content: `Glass has long been considered a super sustainable material, since its reuse is infinite untilâ€¦ it breaks!

        Broken glass is still a challenge for co-ops, as there is a cost of collection and sorting, on account of the risk of accidents of the members, which doesn't pay as much when compared to the value received from the sale of the material.`

        title: `Paper packaging`,
        content: `The recycling rate for paper packaging is one of the highest among recycled materials.

        In addition, the paper has a maximum decomposition time of 100 years, a much smaller number than when compared to other groups, where, for exemple, plastic takes 500 years to decompose.
        
        Both facts make packaging made with this type of material much more sustainable, by the high level of recyclability (even pizza boxes can be recycled) and by the short decomposition time.`

        title: `Metal packaging`,
        content: `Within the metal category there are several types (steel, aluminum, copper and others). This type of material is extremely recyclable and recycled, for having a low cost in the recycling process and for resulting in a quality raw material.

        Currently, aluminum and steel cans have a recycling margin greater than 90% and 60%, respectively.
        
        These numbers are good not only for the environment, but also for the economy.`

        The so-called Tailings: tissues, toilet paper, absorbents and dirty paper napkins, photographs, foam, acrylic, mirrors, ceramics, porcelain, bricks etc.
        Specific contaminating waste such as cells and batteries.
        Hospital waste: cotton, syringes, needles, gauze, bandages etc.
